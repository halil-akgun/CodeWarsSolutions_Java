/*
Given an array of integers, transform it so that at least a certain number of elements in the array are equal.
To achieve this, you can perform an operation where you select an element in the array and
divide it by the given division parameter using integer division.
What is the minimum number of operations that must be performed to achieve this goal on a certain array?
For example, let's say arr =[1â€š 2, 3, 4, 5].
The desired number of equal elements is denoted as threshold = 3, and the division parameter is d= 2.
If you divide the value 4 once and the value 5 once using integer division, you get the array [1, 2, 3, 2, 2],
which contains 3 equal elements. There is no way to achieve this in less than 2 operations. Therefore, the answer is 2.

Function Description
Complete the function minOperations in the editor below.

minOperations has the following parameter(s):
int arr[n]: an array of integers
int threshold: the minimum number of desired equal elements in the array
int d: the division parameter used to divide an element in a single operation


Returns:
int: the minimum number ofoperations required to have at least thresho/d number of equal elements in the array

Contraints
1 <= n <= 30000
1 <= arr[i] <= 200000
1 <= thresholds <= n
2 <= d <= 1000

Input Format For Custom Testing
The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the size of the array.
Each line i of the n subsequent lines (where 0 <= i <= n) contains an integer that describes arr[i].
The next line contains an integer, threshold, denoting the minimum number of desired elements in the array.
The next line contains an integer, d, denoting the division parameter.

Sample Case
sample Input For Custom Testing :
[4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3]
Sample Output : 6
Explanation:
In this case,  the arr = [1, 2, 3, 4], threshold = 4, and the division parameter d = 3.
In other words, the minimum required number of equal elements is 4, and in one operation
we can divide a single element by 3 using integer division.
The only way to get all 4 elements to be equal is to divide all of them so they all become 0.
One operation is required to conver 1 to 0, and another single opeartion is required to convert 2 to 0.
Two operations are required to convert 3 to 0, and another two operations are needed to convert 4 to 0.
Therefore, the total number of required operations is 1+1+2+2=6.
